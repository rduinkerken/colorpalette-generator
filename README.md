# Colorpalette Generator
## Why should I use it?
To create overview of your website's colors.

## How does it work?
1. Fill in your HEX color code
2. Fill in the reference of your color (e.g: primary, alt or blue)

I like to screenshot my result and place it inside my website's documentation.

## To do
- [ ] also show RGB variant of HEX color
- [ ] make text inside color box readable (e.g: any text you place inside #e3e3e3 color block is barely visible)
    - [ ] button: export to png
